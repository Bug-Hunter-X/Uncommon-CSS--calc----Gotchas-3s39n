The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations, but it can lead to unexpected results if not used carefully. For example, if you try to calculate a value that results in a negative number, it might not render as expected.  Another common mistake involves forgetting to include spaces around the `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/` operators inside the `calc()` function. Forgetting to include units (like `px`, `em`, `%`) on values within `calc()` can also cause problems. Using nested `calc()` functions excessively can become hard to read and debug.
